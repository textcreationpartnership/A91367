            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But for all ye whoſe hearts are upright with the Lord, the time is at hand, when the reproach and contempt that is now caſt upon you, ſhall be quite taken away; for your Father will make you the head and not the tayle, as doth appeare by theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 8, 9. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 23, 24. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 13, 14. <hi>Zech.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 18, 19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 23. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 13. <hi>and Iſay.</hi> 66. 6, 7. <hi>and</hi> 65. 21, 22. <hi>and</hi> 61. 4. <hi>and</hi> 60. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe contemptible deſpiſed Saints that now many doe thruſt ſorely at, and others look a ſquint upon, ſome ſhut the doore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, others turn their backs upon, and moſt of men, do either neglect them or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them; But, Oh! poor Saints lift up your heads, your redemptirn draweth nigh, ye ſhall receive of his fulneſſe grace for grace, what ſoever grace there is in Chriſt, there is the like ſtamped upon every true Chriſtian. Is Jeſus Chriſt called the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God? ſo are the Saints too. Is he called the Son of God? the Saints are alſo
<pb facs="tcp:119761:4"/> called the Sons of God. Is Chriſt called Heire? the Saints are ſaid to be Heirs, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heires with Chriſt. Is he ſaid to be elect and precious? ſo are the Saints, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
            <p>Is he called the light of the world, the true light? they are called alſo, <hi>light in the Lord, Eph.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
            <p>Is he ſaid to be ſanctified? So are the Saints alſo, <hi>For their ſakes ſanctifie I my ſelfe, that they alſo may be ſanctified through the truth,</hi> Iohn 17. 19.</p>
            <p>Is he ſaid to be full of Grace and Truth? ſo are the Saints too; ſome of them, as <hi>Stephen,</hi> full of Grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 55. and <hi>Mary</hi> full of Grace. Thus doth the Lord honour thoſe that doe honour him with ſuch titles of honour; and the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this doth put the Soule upon Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall duties from Spirituall principles, as from the ſence of Divine love that doth conſtraine the ſoule to wait on God, and to act for God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſinne live any longer therein?</hi> So againe, <hi>I beſeech you brethren, by the mercies of God; that ye preſent your</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119761:5"/> 
               <hi>bodies a living Sacrifice, holy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 12. 1. So <hi>John, Theſe things I write unto you, that ye ſin not.</hi> What was it that he wrote? He wrote that we have fellowſhip with the Father and the Sonne, and that the bloud of Chriſt clenſeth us from all ſinne. And that if we confeſse our ſinnes, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſinnes; and that, if we ſinne, we have an Advocate with the Father Ieſus Chriſt the righteous: Theſe choiſe favours and mercies the Apoſtle holds forth as the chiefeſt meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſoule from ſinne. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world that renders a man more unlike a Saint, and more like to Sathan, then to argue from mercy, to ſinfull liberty; from Divine goodneſſe, to licentiouſneſse, which is the Devills Logick.</p>
            <p>The love of Chriſt being placed in us, the ſame love will be conſtraining of us to have all our converſations and wilkings to be ordered as becometh children of ſuch a Father; the members of ſuch a body; the Heyres of ſuch promiſes; the Temples of ſuch a Holy Ghoſt: and the hearing
<pb facs="tcp:119761:5"/> and believing then of what God hath done for us in Christ, is the moſt prevailing meanes of drawing men in to believe in Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9, 10. God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his love to us in this, that while we were yet ſinners, Christ dyed for us, and ſo a right truſting in him ſpringeth from the very power of his Holy Spirit in us working the ſame, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening and Declaration of his name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 9. 10. this is a Faith that ſpringeth from, and worketh by love.</p>
            <p>But ſuch a Faith none can have, till the love of God is diſcovered to them, and ſo they ſee and believe his goodneſſe towards them. The ſerious conſideration of this would put a check upon that prepoſterous mistake about mens teaching the Doctrine of Election and Reprobation unto the world, and limitting the Goſpell and death of Chriſt unto a few only, which is not in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of Christ given to the Apoſtles, but rather to preach the Goſpell to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature, and to invite them to that
<pb facs="tcp:119761:6"/> feaſt prepared by Chriſt, and all things ready for their entertainment, and that God is willing to receive them, and ſo invite all and call upon all to goe to the wedding to believe and ſubmit unto him; and when this Goſpell hath taken its effect upon ſome, that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to let goe all for him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, to believe in him, and cleave to him, then to minde them of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Election, as the Apoſtles did apply it to believers, minding them it was Gods goodneſſe and free grace to elect them in Chriſt before the foundation of the world; ſo that now they are begotten to the Faith, they are to give all diligence to make their Calling and Election ſure; but many men endeavour to hold forth to the world thoſe decrees of Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, which they rightly understand not, making them dangerous and unprofitable Doctrines, which otherwiſe in due place and manner propounded are very ſafe and wholſome, for herein they goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the rule, preaching an uncertaine ſound, which the world can make no good
<pb facs="tcp:119761:6"/> uſe of: for when they heare it, what uſe can they have of it, but to perplex, or harden them? for what other conſequence can they naturally draw from thence then this, Either I am Elected, or not; If I be, then I am well enough, no ſinne can, or ſhall hurt me: no matter whether I heare, pray, read, or not: If otherwiſe, I ſhall but here torment my ſelf with a melancholy and religious life in vaine: what profits it for me to pray unto him? no duties will profit me, therefore I will take my pleaſure; no actions of mine can either help or hinder, &amp;c. whereas he ſhould be wraſtling with God, as <hi>Jacob,</hi> and give him no reſt till he had obtained the bleſsing.</p>
            <p>What I have endeavoured to preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, in this enſuing Treatiſe, as in a Map, doe you conſider more particularly, viewing and weighing well the ſtumbling-blocks caſt in youo way, and the corruption of your owne underſtanding, memory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, will, and affections, with thoughts, words, actions, omiſsions, commiſsions; we cannot likely goe too far in theſe things, nor wrong your nature: yea, take a man that
<pb facs="tcp:119761:7"/> thinketh worſt of himſelfe, he is far worſe then he thinketh himſelfe to be. In a word, our well-being doth much depend upon our removing theſe ſtumbling-blocks; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, they cannot be without Faith, and Faith is the work of the Spirit of God in us, out of the free love of God to us, not for any good done by us, or foreſeen in us; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by nature all in miſery we were objects of mercy, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 6. and ſo after in mercy he had clenſed us, we were beautifull through the comlineſſe that he had put upon us, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>Election is the Election of grace; Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is according to grace; Regeneration was of Gods owne will, Faith is the gift of God, Justification is freely by grace, Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinnes is according to the riches of his grace, Eternall life is the gift of God; all the Portion that God expecteth of us is Poverty.</p>
            <p>Oh! the conſideration of this free love of God held forth in the Goſpel, will engage the ſoule to a conſtant ſpirituall combat by faith, and hope, and other graces of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit againſt the fleſh, and ſo by the ſpirit

            <p>This word of grace hath a purifying fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in it; <hi>Ye are clean through the word I have ſpoken to you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15. 3.</p>
            <p>Againe, the Word is as an Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 11. and as a lamp diſcovering the ſpot, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. and as a Starre conducting to Chriſt the Fountain of purifying, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>Zach</hi> 13. 1. and as a rule according to which we are heedfully to order our converſation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 9. and the chiefest motive unto ſelfe-purifying, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. The appearing of this ſtirreth up fervent deſires and prayers for thorough purity. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 9. <hi>Clenſe thou me from ſecret faults; purge me with Hyſop, and I ſhall be cleane,</hi> Pſal.

Now we cannot come out of this miſerable eſtate, untill we come to him who is the fountain of life, and brought to him, we can never be but <hi>by faith, Heb.</hi> 11. 6. For as God is the life of the ſoul, and the ſoul is the life of the body, ſo faith is the life of our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the promiſes are the life of faith; now when a man or woman comes to be throughly, and powerfully, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually convinced, that he or ſhe was born in ſin, and have ever ſince lived in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119761:10"/> ſin; and that all the plagues and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threatned in the whole Bible are due to them for their ſins, as appears by theſe Scriptures: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death: Rev.</hi> 14. 10. <hi>Theſe ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is powred forth without mixture, in the cup of his indignation: Pſal.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and all they that forget God: Rom.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anguiſh, indignation and wrath, upon every ſoul of man that doth evill, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile:</hi> ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>But beſides all this the ſinfulneſſe of man by nature will further appear, if we examine every faculty of the ſoul: <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>underſtanding</hi> is full of vanity, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 11. nay it is full of blindneſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 24. unteachableneſſe and incredulity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. So the <hi>will</hi> of man is wholly depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: 1. It is contrary to God, his word and Spirit in all things; 2. It will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend nor wait on God; 3. it is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in good reſolutions; 4. it diſobeyes the will of God: as we may ſee in <hi>Adams</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the fruit, and <hi>Sauls</hi> ſparing the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites</hi> King and Cattle. Then for the <hi>memory,</hi> that alſo is full of corruption. 1. That will forget the things that it is commanded to remember: 2. It will remember the things,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119761:11"/> that we are commanded to forget, it will hold trifles, and let go matters of moment. So the <hi>conſcience</hi> that is wholly corrupted; 1. it is without feeling, it is neither clear to ſee things that are amiſſe, nor ſenſible of ſins committed: 2. Whereas it ſhould excuſe or accuſe, it doth abuſe and pervert the light it hath by making great ſins ſmall, &amp;c. Then for our <hi>affections,</hi> they are alſo corrupt, they come as a tempeſt and carry us away, either to make us over-love, over-grieve, over-joy; &amp;c. we hate our brother which we ſhould love, &amp; love our luſts whom we ſhould hate: by all which we may ſee that our nature is full of unrighteouſneſſe, and ungodlineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If thou, and I conſider what we are by <hi>practiſe,</hi> we may quickly finde our ſins to be more then the hairs of our heads, or ſands on the ſea ſhore. Examine firſt thy actuall ſins, of thought, word, and deed<hi>:</hi> in our <hi>thoughts</hi> there is much corruption, they being idle, vain, wicked, and ſo fooliſh, as Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> ſaith, <hi>If a man ſhould write his thoughts of one day, and read them at night, he would think he was half out of his wits:</hi> now thoughts are the firſt born, and bloſſome of the ſoul, and are the firſt plotters and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of good or evill, with them we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain good in the temple of our hearts. Then for our <hi>words,</hi> the tongue being very
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119761:11"/> ſlippery, we offend eaſily, St. <hi>James</hi> compares <hi>the tongue</hi> to <hi>a bit,</hi> which keeps in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt horſe, and to <hi>a rudder, which turnes the greatest ſhip,</hi> and to <hi>a fire, which inflames the whole courſe of nature, Jam.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. Yet moſt men think it nothing to let their tongues walk up and down at randome, from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning till night, from week to week, from moneth to moneth, from year to year. Then ſee it again by moſt mens actions, their ſins of commiſſion, their number, greatneſſe, frequency, and thou wilt ſoon ſay as in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12. <hi>Who can underſtand his errours?</hi> Then again, for <hi>ſins of omiſſion,</hi> thy barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and unfruitfulneſſe, thy omitting of time that is ſo precious, and omitting of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of doing good, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 45. Again let us conſider the <hi>aggravations of ſin,</hi> firſt every ſin is againſt the great Majeſty of God, the greater the perſon offended is, the greater the ſin committed is.</p>
               <p>Again, we ſin againſt <hi>knowledge:</hi> it was the great ſin of the Gentiles, that when they <hi>knew God they glorified him not as God;</hi> to ſin againſt knowledge, is a reſiſting the holy Ghoſt: <hi>tribulation</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is <hi>firſt to the Jew,</hi> that knew the will of God, and then <hi>to the Gentile</hi> Now the Gentiles had but the light of nature<hi>:</hi> ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 9. Again, another aggravation of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119761:12"/> ſin is this, we have ſinned againſt <hi>vowes</hi> and <hi>covenants</hi> made with God; now ſin after covenant is greater then it was before, though in act it be but the ſame. Again, we ſin againſt <hi>means,</hi> yea againſt thoſe means that God hath put as <hi>weapons</hi> in our hands to reſiſt it; as mercies or corrections of God, or his word, whereby we profit not.</p>
               <p>Now all this that hath been ſpoken hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto of our ſinfull condition by nature and practiſe, is but a taſte of one drop to the Ocean, to that bulk and body of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that lyeth covered in our hearts, as fire under aſhes; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12. <hi>Who can underſtand the errors of his life?</hi> ſaith <hi>David, I will ſet thy ſins in order before thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered, is the judgements threatned againſt thoſe ſins: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 22. <hi>Now conſider this,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>leſt I come and tear you in pieces: Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that continueth not in every thing that is written, Gal.</hi> 3. 10. and, <hi>he that keepeth the whole Law, and offends but in one point is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all: Jam.</hi> 2. 10. ſo that ſin and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are linked together. See the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned places, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 32. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 17. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 9. &amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:119761:12"/>
               <p> Now when the ſoul ſeeth his ſin, and the judgements due to him for ſin, then the ſoul doth begin to make a ſtop, and to conſider where it is, and whither it is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and as it looks up, it ſeeth an angry Judge ready to pronounce his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as it looks down, it ſees hell mouth open ready to receive it: If thou look before thee, all the world ſeems in a flame of fire<hi>:</hi> and behinde thee a hideous noiſe of an innumerable number of thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſinners, at their wits ends, crying out with the Jaylor, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> or elſe with the four leapers 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 3, 4. <hi>If we ſhould enter into the city, the famine is there, and we ſhall dye; and if we ſit ſtill here, we die alſo; Now therefore let us fall into the hands of the Aſſyrians, if they ſave us alive we live, if not we ſhall but die:</hi> Even thus is it with every ſoul, a little convinced of his ſinfull life, loſt and undone condition. Firſt, if we ſhould look back, and enter into the City of all the good that we have done, the famine is there, and we ſhall die; and if we ſit ſtill here in this ſtate of nature, not improving the opportunity, nor abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is in our hands, we die alſo: now therefore let us fall into the hands of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> if they ſave us alive, we ſhall live, if not, we ſhall but die. This third and laſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119761:13"/> reſolution of the Lepers, doth ſhew and fully diſcover to all men that have their eyes in their heads, that a man or woman once convinced of ſin, both originall and actuall, of omiſſion and commiſſion, both in fleſh and ſpirit, with all its aggravations and denominations, this party ſeeks for healing, but it goes to the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that could not help themſelves: ſo we, even we the moſt of men, awakened out of a ſecure eſtate of ſin, the ſoul ſeeks and comes to the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> of his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and when he comes to the camp, he findes that fled away, then he returns to all his friends and relations, and finds them unable to help themſelves, much leſte to help him: Then the ſoul comes to the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> of his own duties, and ordinances, and ſo reſts upon a form without the power, and ſo we wil never come to Chriſt, the true and only phyſician of the ſoul, untill with the woman in <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27, 28. we have ſpent all our money, time and pains, and left no ſtone unturned, no means unattempted, to get cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e and healing in ſomething beſide, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but when with this woman we have ſpent all, and yet grow worſe and worſe, then the ſoul begins to make a halt or ſtop again, and ſo begins to reaſon with it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119761:13"/> ſelf; If I ſit ſtill here in the ſtate of nature, I ſhall die, or if I ſhould go into the City of my own works, the Lord hath written death upon that, no fleſh ſhall be juſtified by that: I will even fall into the hands of God, the great Creator of the <hi>Aſſyrians, Who can tell but that he may be gracious unto me, that I periſh not? Jonah</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 14. Nay <hi>the Lord may be gracious to me and ſave me, Amos</hi> 5. 15. Oh let me and all thoſe my fellow ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, fall into his hands, it may be we ſhall be hid in the day of the Lords wrath: It is true, we being wicked he may ſay to us as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16. <hi>What haſt thou to do to take my Covenant into thy mouth?</hi> But for all this, I am reſolved ſaith one, I am reſolved ſaith another, to go to him, and caſt my ſelf upon him, although it doth ſeem to be contrary to his law, which is our Debt-book, yet there doth ſeem to be a way opened in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, which is the Pay-book, where if I miſtake not, are Receipts for moſt of my debts, if not for all<hi>:</hi> Wherefore as <hi>Eſther</hi> 4. 16. ſhe reſolved to go to the King, though it was contrary to the Law; So am I, ſaith the convinced ſinner, reſolved to go in to the King of Kings, and <hi>if I periſh I periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſometimes before the ſoul comes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119761:14"/> to this ſtrong reſolution, even when once it begins to be throughly convinced of ſin, it makes a ſtop or halt, like a traveller meeting with two waies, and knows not which to take, he ſtands ſtill and takes neither of them for the preſent, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues inquiring of all that paſſe by, and at laſt having ſilenced his own thoughts, he hears a voice behinde him ſaying, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 21. <hi>This is the way, walk in it,</hi> and ſo the Lords gives a mighty turn to the ſoul by that ſecret voice; but before the ſoul comes thus farre, there is wrought in the ſoul the aſſenting act of faith, but not the applying act; now the aſſenting act is that whereby a man aſſents to the truth of the Scripture; that he is ſuch a miſerable wretch as the Scripture ſaith, that he ſhall periſh eternally, if he be not new born, and taken out of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and graffed in the ſecond.</p>
               <p>But ſome will object or demand, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſoul thus convinced doth beleeve firſt, or repent, before it doth beleeve.</p>

               <p> Now the aſſenting act of faith is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and ſo godly ſorrow is an effect of it; ſo that this aſſenting act of faith, leads a ſoul to an ordinance in Gods hand, as to the firſt part of repentance, conſiſting in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, contrition, and humiliation; now the habit of faith and repentance are both together in the ſoul, we only queſtion which God doth give the ſoule power to act firſt; and for the further clearing hereof conſider, That a ſoul cannot come to Chriſt, till it goes out of its ſelfe; now a ſoul will not goe out of its ſelf, till it doth ſee the danger of continuing in its ſelf: this danger workes fear, this fear workes ſorrow, and this ſorrow is humiliation; and this cannot be without the firſt act of faith, ſeeing we cannot dive into the diſpenſations of God, by a bucket of reaſon. It is true that the troop of Converts <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. they were <hi>pricked at their hearts, and ſaid unto</hi> Peter <hi>and the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> and in <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 29. the Jaylor came trembling, and fell at their feet and ſaid, <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> So that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is the effect of faith, and the cauſe muſt needs go before the effect; only minde that repentance hath three parts, to wit, conviction, contrition, and humiliation, or the turning of the ſoul from ſin, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119761:15"/> the converſion of the ſoul to God, and this cannot be done in Gods ordinary way, before the habit of faith be wrought in the ſoul; ſo that we may judge of the habit of faith, by the acts of humiliation that it doth work in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered is, What is that converſion of a ſinner, ſo much ſpoken unto in the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>For anſwer unto which, it is moſt clear by Scripture, and experience, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a man is as hard a thing as to turn the courſe of nature: rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments propoſed may turn mens actions, but to turn the inclination of the heart is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Spirit of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>By the Spirit of the Lord we are changed into the Image of God;</hi> and this Spirit will ſhew you the corruption of your underſtanding, memory, conſcience, will, and aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

There is no power below that power, that raiſed Chriſt from the dead, and that made the world, that can turn the heart of a ſinner; we are as well able to turn a flint into fleſh, as to turn our own hearts to the Lord; to raiſe the dead, and to make a world, as to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119761:15"/> repent; Repentance is a flower that grows not in natures garden; <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots? then may they alſo that are accuſtomed to do evill, do good, Jer.</hi> 13. 23. Repentance is a gift that comes down from above, men are not born with repentance in their hearts, as they are born with tongues in their mouths; the ſame power that formes the child in the naturall wombe, for the child doth not forme its ſelfe; and its father and mother are but the meanes; I ſay, the ſame power that gives it the firſt birth, muſt give it the ſecond birth, or elſe it will not be <hi>borne again,</hi> and if not, it can <hi>never enter into the Kingdome of heaven, Joh.</hi> 3. 3. No power, but the power of the Almighty, can convert a ſinner or recover a backſlider; <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ephraim: After that I was turned I repented,</hi> ſaith he. For as Mr. <hi>Thomas Brooks</hi> well obſerves, repentance hath in it theſe three things; 1. The act; to turne from darkneſſe to light. 2. The ſubject chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that is, the whole man, both the ſinners heart and life; firſt his heart, then his life; firſt his perſon, then his practiſe; it is a through change both of the mind and man. 3.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119761:16"/> that is, from all ſin, to good; repentance is not only a turning from all ſin, but alſo a turning to all good, at leaſt to love all good, to a prizing of all good, and to a following after all good, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 21. &amp;c. it is not enough that the tree beares not bad or ill fruit, but it muſt bring forth <hi>good fruit,</hi> elſe it muſt be <hi>cut down and caſt into the fire;</hi> true repentance ſtrips a man ſtarke naked of all the garment of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and leaves not ſo much as a skirt behind in this rotten building.

                  <p>For if the regenerate might ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, then they might totally and finally fall away from God, but that it is impoſſible, as that Gods Promiſes, Covenant, and faithfulneſſe ſhould fail, or that Gods Spirit, grace, and power preſerving them ſhould be overcome, or that Gods immutable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for their ſalvation ſhould be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſo that there is a vaſt difference, between the ſinning of a regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and their ſinning that ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

                  <p n="1">(1.) Internall, he can but act as a Chriſtian, move as a Chriſtian, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as a Chriſtian, but not from any principle of life living in the ſoul; Did not <hi>Saul</hi> act as a Chriſtian, and yet he was but a Hypocrite? <hi>Jehu</hi> in the forme did the thing which was good, but from a corrupt principle within; <hi>Judas</hi> alſo he was an exact picture of a Chriſtian only in forme, but his principle was covetouſneſſe; <hi>Demas</hi> had a forme but not a power, and ſo he <hi>imbraced the preſent World.</hi>

If moſt men under a forme, did not reſt upon a forme, what is then the reaſon of that ſtupidity, that neither mercies nor judgements will worke upon men, but only preſent ſtrokes or rewards? What is the reaſon that men be ſo carefull about, and taken up ſo much with preſent and future things that are temporall, and ſo careleſſe about preſent and future things that are eternall, if we do not ſtick in a forme? What is the reaſon that we be ſo apt to goe to Creatures for helpe, and not to God? Again, What is the reaſon that we refuſe croſſes rather then ſinne, although we know that ſinne is the greateſt evill? What is the reaſon that we be ſo fearefull to diſpleaſe a potent enemy, rather then God? Again, What is the reaſon that men make ſo many ſhifts and lies to cover their ſinnes before men, to make all things appear fair to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to God? ſo that moſt men will rather lay their folly open by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes

                  <p>2. In the next place, let me according to the meaſure of light in me, give ſome Characters of one that hath the power of Godlineſſe as well as the forme. The power of Godlineſſe in its higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, is but the fruit of grace; grace is the cauſe of Godlineſſe, as fire is the cauſe of heat; and yet as the cauſe is, ſuch is the effect, for powerfull cauſes makes powerfull effects: Godlineſſe is the right exerciſing and acting of thoſe graces which the ſoul hath received of the Spirit of God, both to the glory of God, and the good of man, or the bringing forth of the fruites of grace in holineſſe of life and converſation; that is, when he improves all his ſpirituall ſtrength given unto him to the advantage of his Maſter Chriſt; not only to improve, but alſo to be glad of every occaſion whereby he may advance the glory of that God that hath advanced him by the glory of his grace. Oh the invincible power of grace to make ſuch a change in man! his eyes are now opened, his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inlightned, his judgement informed,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119761:75"/> his affection turned, he is not now the man he was; Oh happy conviction! Oh bleſſed change indeed<hi>!</hi> for a man in one houre to have his night turned into day, his forme into power, his darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into light, his bitter into ſweet, Gods frowns into ſmiles, his hatred into love, his hell into heaven, his bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage into adoption, his taske into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, his greateſt worke into the greateſt pleaſantneſſe<hi>!</hi> this man runs the wayes of his Commandements with delight; Oh! what is become of thoſe breathings and longing that were in the primitive Saints?</p>
                  <p>Again, that man that hath the power of Godlineſſe is not ſatisfied in the bare uſe of the forme when he goes to hear the Word preached; unleſſe it comes in with power, and warme his heart, he comes home unſatisfyed.</p>
                  <p>So again, when he doth read, and confer and meditate, unleſſe his heart be affected with, and his ſoule refreſhed by theſe Pipes of conveyance, he remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfyed: whereas the other that reſts in the forme is quiet in the worke done: and ſo we might inſtance in every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, he looks to God through them,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119761:75"/> he dares not make Saviours of them, but waits upon God in the uſe of them, as the man at the pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> or as a path that leads him to a rock that is higher then he, where he hath pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſalutations, interchangeable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, ſweet fellowſhip, refreſhing familiarities, infinite, ſoul-ſatisfying communities; this ſoul takes up his reſting place be this ſide heaven; and in the performance of any duty required by God, the ſoul lookes to the principle, manner how, and to the ends why he doth it, and if he finde not all clear, then he looks upon his obedience as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</p>
                  <p>Again, he that hath the power of Godlineſſe will perſevere in the uſe of all Gods ordinances, he will pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, at all times, with all manner of prayers, and will not admit of a denyall, he prayes and waites, and prayes and waites, and beleives, ſaying, hee will ariſe and give, he will ſend me an anſwer of peace.</p>
                  <p>Now oh thou miſgiving ſoul, doſt not thou finde truthes in thy inward
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119761:76"/> parts, and that although thou doeſt not make ſo fair a ſhew in the fleſh as ſome others, haſt thou not ſome inward brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, and ſpirituall longings, and ſoul-meltings? doeſt thou not eſteem one ſmile of Chriſt better then the ſmiles of all relations? Doeſt thou not look upon all the formes of godlineſſe as pipes of conveyances, walks and paths, wherein thou expecteſt to meet with thy Saviour, and art not ſatisfied in the uſe of them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thy ſoul meet with Chriſt in them.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119761:77"/> or condemns the party for improving, or not improving this power beſtowed on him, to ſpeak after the manner of men: let us then conſider, the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable creatures, as the Swallow, the Piſmire, the Crane, and the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; all theſe have received a power from God, and hath God given no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to man, whom he hath made Lord of all theſe creatures? Man hath a great power over the beaſts; for man is a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour: but the beaſts themſelves have a great deal of power over the graſſe and hearbs, for the beaſt is the ſuperiour. In a word, if the Scriptures ſhall be our rule, and the Spirit our guide, and the glory of God our aime, then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holds forth a twofold power that is diſtributed or given forth to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<hi>:</hi> the firſt is common to all, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is proper only to ſome. The firſt is naturall, the ſecond is ſpirituall. The naturall power is given forth univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to every mothers ſonne and daughter of us, as one talent which we ought not to hide in a napkin<hi>:</hi> ſo <hi>Pilat</hi> had <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived power,</hi> as Chriſt tels him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 10, 11. Again, have any of us done ſo much good, or refrained ſo much evill,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119761:77"/> as we might have done? See <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 35. 6. 18, 19. Yea the worſt of all created creatures, the Devill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath a power: Firſt, he hath the power of conqueſt; for in <hi>Adams</hi> fall, Satan conquered the whole world, all mankinde, they were the Devils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt upon the fall; ſo that when a man is converted, then he is ſaid to come out of the Kingdome of Satan; but ſince this head doth begin to be brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he cannot doe all things without leave. There was a ſpeciall tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the countrey in his running their heard of ſwine into the ſea, and he had leave for that before he did it: there was a ſpeciall temptation upon <hi>Ahab</hi> in the lying ſpirit of the Prophets, and he had a ſpeciall leave and permiſſion from God<hi>:</hi> there was a ſpeciall temptation coming down upon the Diſciples, and he would have had leave for that; <hi>Simon, Simon, Satan hath deſired you:</hi> he was fain to aske leave, before he can execute his power; he is called in Scripture, <hi>The Prince of the power of the aire;</hi> the ſame words that are given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for good in Scripture, are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven alſo unto Satan for evill, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Sayes <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thine heart?</hi> Now doth God impower Fowls, and Fiſhes, and Beaſts of the earth, and every one to act in his kinde, and is man left powerleſſe? Nay, hath the Devill himſelf a power, and man none? this is the errour of men, not the language of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for the Lord is ſo juſt, and his waies ſo equall, that he never requires impoſſible things of his creatures<hi>:</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take notice of this by the way, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I doe affirme that all men have a naturall power, yet I doe not ſay that every man naturally hath it in the ſame meaſure; neither doe I ſay or affirme that naturall power can act in ſupernaturall things, no more then
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:119761:78"/> a bird can live in the ſea, or a fiſh in the air. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>2. There is a ſpirituall power, and this is not given forth to all univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, as the other is, but only to thoſe that are new born: by this power according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt, they can pray in the Spirit, rejoyce in the Spirit, and worſhip God in the Spirit; by this power they pull down ſtrong houſes, and caſt down imaginations, by this power they can keep down their corruptible body, as <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27.</p>
                  <p>Now if any body ſhould ſay, that a new creature hath no ſpirituall power, I will aske him, to what end is there ſo many precepts, exhortations, and perſwaſions to theſe people? If no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in theſe men (ceaſe to teach man) as good goe teach the Sunne, Moon and Stars which way they ſhall goe, the winde to blow, or the ſea to ebbe and flow; goe teach the fiſh to ſwim, the bird to flie; for they have power, but by their opinion, man hath none<hi>:</hi> and indeed if man ſpiritually ſhould have no power to act, goe and raſe out theſe and the like enſuing Scriptures, as
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119761:79"/> requiring that of man, which he hath no power to doe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. &amp; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7. &amp; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 13. Let no man therefore ſay, that he hath no power in any ſenſe, leſt he make God the author of all his omiſſions, which ſhould be charged upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not upon the Creator; for he gives to every man ſome talent, or talents, (as to ſome worldly and naturall talents, as wiſdome, wealth, and art, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and to others ſpirituall talents or gifts, as to propheſie, interpret, work miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Queſtionleſſe there is no man that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves his talent ſo well as he ought and might improve it: and God may, upon the non-improvement of what we have, deny us more, and where he finds us faithleſſe in a little, it's but meet that he ſhould deny us much: alſo God may very juſtly damn men for not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving what he gives them, and call them to an account as a Lord doth his faithleſſe and unprofitable ſervant and ſteward; therefore the very Heathens that had but the very light of nature, will be inexcuſable at the day of Judgement,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:119761:79"/> for not walking and acting according to that light and inſtinct in them, though they never heard Scripture, Law, nor Goſpell. So that to ſinne againſt the law of nature onely, is enough to damn men: if the improving of the law of nature is not ſufficient to ſave men, for there is a knowledge of Chriſt, faith in him, obedience to him, required as abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. 8. 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 27. So that election and reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are not in any ſenſe, cauſes of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and damnation, but Chriſt is the proper and meritorious cauſe of ſalvation, and ſin the proper and meritorious cauſe of damnation; ſo that election and reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are but precedent acts or decrees, and the cauſes of ſalvation and damnation, they come in between the decrees and the execution thereof. So then if we conſider men in themſelves, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, they are dead in their ſins, without any ſpirituall ſtrength, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither will nor ſpirituall power, neither in themſelves, nor of themſelves either to beleeve, or to doe any good work from any true principle, or for any good end; therefore Gods grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth us before we can be able, and

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Feaveriſh heats of violent headineſſe, in ſtead of well-tempered zeale for God and godlineſſe, may inflame it, and ſometimes the cold anguiſh or Palſy-humours of deadneſſe in and benumedneſſe to ſpirituall motions, in its tendency to its ſpirituall and ſupream end, may ſo ſeaſe upon him, as much to impaire its ſtrength, and to outward appearance bring it nigh unto death; but God whoſe temple it is, commande thee not to judge according to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, but to judge righteous

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:119761:92"/> that they deny in Uſe, and hold forth that in Uſe that they deny in Practiſe? And then for the Hearers, how is hearing turned into a forme, and ſo Satan deceives us? if Satan can he will keep the Goſpel from being preached; if he cannot do that, he will labour to poyſon the doctrine; if he cannot do that, he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep the people from hearing; if he cannot prevaile in that, he will endeavour to have them hear negligently; if he cannot do that, he will endevour to hinder them in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe things that doe moſt concern them; if he cannot do that, then he will do what he can to hinder them in the practiſe of what they have heard, learned, received, and treaſured up; and if ſo, no mervail that there is ſo much preaching and hearing, and ſo little good done, that we might even ſay, the converting power of the Ordinances are gone, we ſee not God in them, it is even dark, and profeſſors themſelves walk in the dark, and are ſo beſet with temptations that they have much adoe to hold up.</p>
                  <p>Surely there is a way, if we could light on it, there is a ſpirituall skill if we could attain it, if we could find it, we ſhould take a Bible and read, and underſtand what we read, and effect it, believe it, and apply it, and enjoy it; O Lord poure out thy ſpirit and open thoſe Seals wherewith our Bible is ſealed; the Key of Logick
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:119761:92"/> cannot open the Seales, the Key of Rhetorick and Phyloſophy cannot open it; it is that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Key, the ſpirit of the Lord, that can do it; that ſpirit will ſhew us how much of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is already fulfilled, what is now fulfilling, and what is yet to be fulfilled; yea this is the way to know what Scriptures are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood litterally, and what ſpiritually; this will help us how to know when Chriſt ſpeaks My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially, and when he ſpeaks Regally; when he ſpeaks to us as a Prieſt, or as a Pprophet, &amp;c. Now is not this bleſſed Key of the Bible, the Spirit of the Lord, worth an asking? <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. <hi>If ye then being evill know how to give good gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy ſpirit to them that ask him?</hi> Oh let us <hi>ask</hi> then that we may <hi>receive,</hi> that <hi>our joy may be full,</hi> it is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſſe then the mighty work of God to give us underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in his Word. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 25. <hi>Then opened he their underſtanding, that they might underſtand the Scriptures,</hi> by his holy ſpirit, giving them underſtanding; it is true, the Word of God ſhineth as a true light, yet as the cloudy pillar was darkneſs to the Egyptians, ſo are the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pures to carnall and corrupt mindes, becauſe it is ſpiritually diſcerned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. untill the Holy Ghoſt open the underſtanding it cannot apprehend, there is no worſe cloud to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the light of the ſpirit then confidence
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:119761:93"/> in our own wiſdome: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 3, 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7.</p>
                  <p>So that where God who hath the key of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> opens not, there the Goſpel, though never ſo powerfully preached, is hid, and nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth the ſtupid, the drowſie hearer: See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. Therefore let every Chriſtian have a recourſe to thoſe promiſes in Scripture, wherein he hath promiſed to open our blinde eyes, and ſoften our hard hearts, and fill us with the knowledge of his will, and write his Law in our hearts, and manifeſt himſelf to our ſoules; our heavenly Father hath made his will and given us great wealth, rich poſſeſſions, and large legacies, ſo that all his children are great heires, wherefore we ought to come to him with an unſhaken expectation, and a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſuing for all that is promiſed, and not to ſuffer our heavenly Father to purſe or keepe one penny that is due to us by promiſe, but he ſhall be ſure to heare of it, and if he do not preſently give in according to his covenant, then let us draw a Petition and prefer it in the Court of Heaven, where we have an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate pregared, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, to plead our caſe without a fee: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1.

            <head>A mild and gentle word of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe to the ſcattered diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Members of the Late PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>HAve ye ſate ſo long at the Stern, and could ye not ſteer your Ship aright, but let it ſplit againſt a rock? Had ever any Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament longer time to learn to do well then ye had? Had ever any Parliament ſuch a prize put into their hands as ye? Had ever any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſo many Prayers, Tears, and Petitions, as ye have had? Had ever any Parliament ſo many ſignall Teſtimonies of Gods free love, in giving in ſo many victories both by Land and Sea as you? Did ever a Parliament make more ſhew of Piety &amp; Reality then you did? Did ever a Parliament make ſo many Proteſtations, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, Engagements both to God and Man, to eſtabliſh Righteouſneſs, Truth, and Equity, as you? and yet this honourable, long-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, victorious, engaging Parliament, (if not falſifyed the truſt repoſed to them) they did
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:119761:104"/> fruſtrate the expectations of the people that had choſen them: and ſo at laſt came to be laid aſide, either by God, or Man, or both, and ſcarce a tear for them, or any eye to pitty them. Why ſo? did ever a Parl. promiſe more and performe leſs? did ever a Parl. ſeeke greater things for themſelves more then this? were I near them, and had the advantage of their ear, I ſhould whiſper a word of advice unto them, I would intreat them to read, and ſeriouſly conſider that portion of Scripture, <hi>Daniel</hi> 4. 27.</p>
            <p>I would further deſire them to do as our Brother <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, Luke 19. 8. <hi>And</hi> Zacheus <hi>ſtood forth and ſaid unto the Lord, Behold Lord, the halfe of my goods I give to the poore; and if I have taken any thing from any man by forged cavillation,</hi> (or, they may ſay, either upon Publick Faith, or falſe accuſation) <hi>I will reſtore him fourfold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you take this advice, <hi>it may be you ſhall be hid in the day of the Lords anger,</hi> as in <hi>Zephan.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>Oh! Let it never be truly ſaid of you, that ye gaine while the Nation loſeth; neither l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:119761:104"/> thoſe that have been the cauſe (or inſtruments) of our troubles.</p>
            <p>I truſt I may ſay of ſome of the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as once was ſaid of the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3. 4. <hi>Thou haſt a few names yet in</hi> Sardis <hi>which have not defiled their Garments,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But to the reſt of that Houſe, let me tell them, that if they do not lay theſe things to heart, but rather comfort themſelves in the conſideration of any good that they have done; then I ſay unto you, that the divine wiſdome knoweth how to uſe bad men unto good purpoſes; and in the end not only to caſt them off, but to puniſh them when the world is done. Remember the ſtories of <hi>Haman, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and in all ages, ſelf-ſeekers were ſelf-loſers, and ſelf-deſtroyers, <hi>viz. Adam</hi> ſought himſelfe, and loſt himſelfe; <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſought himſelf, and loſt himſelf; who ever ſought himſelf and proſpered? who ever that continued to ſeek himſelf but periſhed?</p>
            <p>If ye ſay, <hi>We had a ſelfe-denying Ordinance;</hi> I ſay, ye had not a ſelf-denying heart and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; (I am ſure, for mine own part, I know it to be ſo;) Beſides, it appearth by your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make your ſelves a perpetuall Parliament, that the next might not queſtion you: it ſeemeth you had almoſt forgotten that next under God, all power fundamentally was in the people of God, and that all perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:119761:105"/> with it as their Truſtees: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it is provided, that ſuch Truſtees be queſtioned for betraying, or ill managing their truſt.</p>
            <p>Some of your actions do call for ſiftings, and the Lord will ſearch you (as with candles) and turn your inſides outward, that ſo ye may give an account of your Stewardſhip, for ye may be ſo no longer Stewards; ſurely there is ſhame written upon ſome of your footſteps, who are ſtanding in ſlippery places. Oh! might ever a Parliament have come off with more honour then you, if ye had but denyed your naturall ſelf, ſinfull ſelf, and religious ſelf?</p>
            <p>Well, I perceive that as a Bird hoppeth from tree to tree, ſo do the honours and riches of this world from man to man: Nay, riches and honours are like the Moon or the Tide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes increaſing or decreaſing; the Moon hath been increaſing, and the Tide hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in (as it is humbly conceived) with you theſe eight or ten years; but now the Moon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the full, and the ſpring Tide at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the Moon is upon decreaſing, and the Tide upon returning.</p>
            <p>Well, I ſee a man may have enough of the world to ſink him, but he can never have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſave him; ſurely many times I ſee the worſt of men have moſt of theſe outward things, and the beſt of men have leaſt of earth,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119761:105"/> and moſt of heaven. I find in Scripture-record that a man may be great and graceleſs with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> honourable and damnable with <hi>Saul,</hi> rich and miſerable with <hi>Dives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! I ſee, I ſee, that one ſtorm at Sea, one coale of Fire, one falſe Friend, one unadviſed word, one falſe Witneſs, may make a rich man a Beggar, and a Priſoner altogether: Surely if this had been conſidered, ſome things had been reformed that were not. Did you never read Pſal. 12. 5. <hi>Now for the oppreſſion of the needy, and for the ſighs of the poore, I will up ſaith the Lord, and will ſet at liberty?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And in Pſalm. 146. 9. <hi>The Lord keepeth the Stranger, he relieveth the Fatherleſſe, and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Did you not know that the oppreſſion of the poor, which was ſo great in the midſt of us, would pull down the judgement of God upon the heads of thoſe that had power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them and would not?</p>
            <p>May not many of you hereafter ſay, as <hi>Philip</hi> the third of <hi>Spain</hi> (whoſe life was free from groſs evils) being in the Agony of death, fear ſtruck into him, and theſe words burſt from him, <hi>Oh would to God I had never reigned! Oh that I had lived a ſolitary life with God, and not oppreſt the people! What doth all my honour profit me, but that I have ſo much the more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my death! My day of account is very</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:119761:106"/> 
               <hi>neere,</hi> and all men ſhall know and feel that the ſleeping of vengeance cauſeth the overflowing of ſin, and the overflowing of oppreſſion cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the overflowing of vengeance.</p>
            <p>Abuſed oportunity will moſt certainly turn into fury; for Gods long forbearance is no acquittance; the day is at hand when he will pay negligent men and women for miſpending precious time, and for the abuſe of new and old mercies in the day of account. Mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are all in print, and they ſhall be read aloud in the eares of all the world, that all the righteous Nation that ſhall enter in, may ſay Amen, to that righteous Sentence that Chriſt ſhall paſs upon all thoſe that had a prize put into their hands to mind his glory, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load his people of their heavy burthens, that the oppreſſed might go free; but they had no heart to it, as in the <hi>Proverbs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But inſtead thereof, ſought great things for themſelves, as, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 45. 5.</p>
            <p>Nay, though <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> (two choice Chriſtians and Champions) did lead and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a long time, notwithſtanding many dangers and difficulties, yet they were at laſt ſhut out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe they did not ſanctifie the Lord God at the water of <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah,</hi> Deut. 32. 15. and Numb. 27. 14, 15. <hi>For ye were diſobedient unto my Word in the ſtrife of the Aſſembly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Most noble, and honoured Sirs,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHom God, even the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, hath at preſent intruſted with the higheſt places, not only in the Field, but alſo in the ſeat of Juſtice: My prayers to God for you are, that the Lord would make you rather gracious, and inwardly holy, then outwardly happy; and give you a ſpirit of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdome, and valour ſuitable to the work that lyeth before you, that ye may improve the preſent oportunity that is put into your hands, for the glory of God that gave it you; Conſider, the preſence of the Lord is in the midſt of you, the prayers of his Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are continually poured out for you, the eyes of the people are upon you, all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſome great things to be done by you: yea, and the other parts of the world look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119761:107"/> you, if ye go on in a way of righteouſneſs they will follow you.</p>
            <p>It will be a glory for the Engliſh Nation to give a bleſſed example to all the people of the earth, to free themſelves from tyranny and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>If a worm might be thought worthy to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you, then give me leave to tell you, there is but one thing in the main that God and his people doe expect from you, <hi>viz.</hi> That ye would eye the Lord Jeſus in all your actings, and advance his Kingdome as much as in you lyeth: and if this be uppermoſt in your hearts, firſt in your thoughts, and moſt conſtant in your purpoſes, ſo that ye do in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prefer, and in your wills deliberately mind the glory of God, the advancement of the Kingdome of his dear Son, by the aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit; then ſhall the work of the Lord proſper in your hands, and the day ſhall be light before you, and his footſteps that are not yet known, ſhall be diſcovered to you, and ye ſhall ſee your work before you.</p>
            <p>Chriſt was once humbled, that we might be exalted; let him now be exalted, that we might willingly be humbled by him; although he be willing to give you grace, yet his glory he will not give to any other: Let it be a comfort for you that he hath exalted you in the hearts of his people; although you are a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119761:107"/> table-talk, and a by-word, and a ſcorn in the hearts, and by the tongues of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Well, would you ſtand your ſelves now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are fallen, and not only keep, but alſo add to the honour which God hath given you? Then make it your buſineſs to exalt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, not only in your ſelves, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in this, and the neighbouring Nations; and remember that the rock of ages pulleth down ſome to the end that others might not exalt themſelves when they are in power; for the Lord hath decreed to ſtain the pride of all earthly honour, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth, that ſo all fleſh might be humbled, and the Lord alone exalted: therefore <hi>ſeek not ye great things for your ſelves;</hi> (as many of thoſe that went before you) leſt ye be laid aſide, and no eye pitty you.</p>
            <p>Provide nothing more for your ſelves then ye have (I beſeech you) but to ſeek for the honour of Chriſt, and the freedome of the Saints, and theſe Nations wherein your owne freedomes and ſafeties are involved: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Lord hath hitherto made ſome of you friends to his people, and a terrour to their and his enemies: and our prayer to the Lord is, that he would teach you as once he did good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to do many years hard ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119761:108"/> freely, becauſe the payments were heavy upon their fellow creatures, as you may ſee in <hi>Neh.</hi> 5. 14. 18.</p>
            <p>That ye may ſay as that ſervant of Chriſt did, to the glory of God, and the ſhame of the former ſelf-ſeeking powers, ver. 15. <hi>But the former Governours that had been before me, were chargable unto the people, and had taken of them their Bread and Wine, beſides fourty ſhekels of Silver; but ſo did not I</hi> (ſaid this good man) <hi>becauſe of the feare of the Lord.</hi> I have but a few things more to begg of you (as upon my bended knees, and with weeping eyes) which if ye will but hear and grant, it may make much for the glory of God, the honour of the three Nations, and the Comfort of your owne Souls.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing is, that ye would ſet ſome time and perſons apart, to heare and receive the private petitions and grievances of the poor Widows and Fatherleſs, ſo much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the former power; for they have poured out their complaints in the midſt of their wants, and their cry came up before the Lord, before the diſſolving of the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Conſider (I requeſt you) That, <hi>the earth and all thereen is the Lords,</hi> (not our Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe) and ye are, at preſent, his Stewards: <hi>wherefore,</hi> as in Prov. 3. 7. <hi>Withhold not good</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:119761:108"/> 
               <hi>from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to doe it.</hi> So in the end ye ſhall be able to ſay with <hi>Job, That ye have not withheld the poore from their deſire, nor cauſed the eyes of the Widow and Fatherleſs to faile, nor ſeen any periſh for want of cloathing, nor ſeen any poore in the ſtreets without covering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(I could almoſt ſay to you, as once <hi>Abraham did</hi> to the Lord, Gen. 18. 27. <hi>Behold, now I have taken upon me to ſpeak, which am but duſt and aſhes;</hi> I would begg leave to preſent a few things more to your ſerious conſideration.)</p>
            <p>The next thing is, That when ye make inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for ravening wolves, propheſied of by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 29. <hi>that come to us in Sheeps cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> that ye would not do as the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did, ſtop the Wolf's mouth in one Town and let him go and devour, or at leaſt, deceive the Sheep in another; if he be adjudged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to bite or devour in one place, let him be held as unfit in another, leſt ye ſhould do as if (in effect) they did put out the fire in <hi>Canne</hi> and ſend it to <hi>Marlborough,</hi> or endeavour to ſtop the plague in <hi>Briſtoll</hi> by ſending the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted perſons to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing that I would begg of you for this poor nation, is, That whereas the laſt Power did promiſe much, and perform little; be ye more like God, I (both humbly and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119761:109"/> earneſtly) requeſt you, by promiſing leſs then ye intend to perform; that ye may appeare to us in very deed to be like him: He promiſed the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only the Land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> but beſides that, he gave them two other Kingdomes which he never did promiſe to give them: And to <hi>Zacharias,</hi> Luke 1. 20. He promiſed to give him his Speech again at the Birth of the Child, but beſide that he gave him the gift of propheſie; ſo that, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He can give and do abundantly, above all that we are able to ask or think.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet that ſay ye abide in him, ought ſo to walk, as ye have him for an example. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 20. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
            <p>The next thing I would beſeech of you, moſt noble and honoured Senators, is this, That ye would endeavour to unite all the Saints ſound in the Faith, to an union in the ſpirit of Love. Though <hi>England</hi> be but as a garden to the whole world, &amp; all the people in it but a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſcarce one of twenty of this handfull godly men; yet were theſe few Saints united by the bleſſed Spirit, ſo, as their hearts might agree together, as touching any thing they ought to ask; and were ſo well affected to lift up one voice, and one heart (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God) they would have the things they ask; ſo as nothing ſhould be too hard for them to do; all the world
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119761:109"/> could not ſtand before them, nor undermine them, for they would be wiſe in the Lords wiſdome, and ſtrong in him, and in the power of his might: Shall <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> agree? <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> agree? <hi>Beares</hi> and <hi>Lyons</hi> agree? <hi>Tygers</hi> and <hi>Wolves</hi> agree? and ſhall not <hi>Saints</hi> agree? If the Saints were but once united, Antichriſt would ſoone be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Oh let not our Supream Power, under God, be angry, and I will ſpeak but this once. Oh let me then ſay to you, as once <hi>Mordecai</hi> did to <hi>Heſter, Heſt.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>If thou altogether holdeſt thy peace at this time, then ſhall their enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come, and deliverance ariſe from another place, or power, but thou and thy Fathers houſe ſhall be deſtroyed; and who knoweth whether thou art come to the Kingdome for ſuch a time as this?</hi> And (under correction) let me tell you, the work is the Lords, and if ye will not carry it on, he will lay you aſide with ſhame, and raiſe up thoſe that he will own and bleſs.</p>
            <p>And whereas moſt of the Godly people in <hi>England</hi> are crying mightily to God for you, to purge out ſelf-ſeeking, and to plant a ſpirit of Government in you, and to furniſh you with naturall and ſpirituall abilities ſuitable to the work that lyeth before you; but if ye begin to flag (as the former power did) and ſo let the work ſtick in the Birth; and every one minding
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:119761:110"/> his owne things, not the things of Jeſus Chriſt; then let me tell you, that all the Lords people in <hi>England,</hi> and the other Nations, will be praying to him, and wreſtling with him, and give him no reſt, night nor day, till the Lord turne you alſo out of doores, and bring in thoſe that he will own and bleſs.</p>
