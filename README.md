1. The way to Heaven diſcovered, and the ſtumbling blocks (caſt therein by the World, Fleſh, and Devill) removed.
ALL Men, Women, and Children under the Sun, are either in the ſtate of Nature, or in the ſtate of GrAnſw. If the Scriptures be not the Word of God, then there is no rule to walk by, but that every manAnſw. It is poſſible here and there a word is not ſo clearly tranſlated, but what is that to thee, ſAnſw. The promiſes do belong unto us now in being as well as unto them, as doth clearly appear by thAnſw. It is true, the word is a ſpirituall word, for holy men of old, ſpake as the Spirit gave them Obj. But for the full removing of this fourth ſtumbling block, I deſire ſatisfaction in theſe enſuinAnſw. In anſwer to the firſt Quaere, what promiſes are made unto, and do belong to Jeſus Chriſt.1. I2. Quaere is, Whether many of the promiſes are not made to the Jewes, and what thoſe promiſes are, t
      * 3. Quaere is, Whether there be not many promiſes made to the Gentiles; and if ſo, then what thoſe promiſes were and are.
Object. But ſaith the poor ſtaggering ſoul, you have removed four ſtumbling blocks that lay in my waAnſw. You are to apply them underſtandingly, and that you may ſo doe, conſider in what condition or Object. But for the full removing of this fift ſtumbling block, I deſire ſatisfaction, ſaith a poor Anſw. It is true, many of the promiſes, are made conditionally.1. If thou doeſt confeſſe and forſakeObject. Well, ſaith the weakned ſinner, or rather young Saint, I have conſidered all this, and yet IAnſw. It is true, mercy in us is but a drop of his Ocean, and but a beam to the fulneſſe that is in Anſw. It is true, Repentance is a worke that muſt be timely done, or men be utterly undone; for God Anſw. Thou art not to enquire after, or once to queſtion thy election, till thou doeſt firſt beleeveAnſw. This temptation is no other, then what is common to man; nay, the beſt of men have had their ſAnſw. Thou maieſt be dearly beloved although ſorely afflicted, for Gods houſe of Correction, is his Anſw. Were there not a height and a depth, a breadth and a length in Gods pardoning mercy, and had hAnſw. I muſt confeſſe this is a ſad condition, It doth give Satan an advantage to triumph: beſides iAnſw. None of the elect before their
 converſion, can know by any ſearch that they are in the faith,Anſw. That place Heb. 6. 4, 5. is not to be underſtood of one or more particular faillings, but of aAnſw. If thou haſt but the leaſt grain of faith in thee, it will lead thee to the Sunne of righteouſAnſw. Originall ſin is the proper ſeed, ſpawn and fountain of this ſin, aſwell as of any other, but Anſw. For the removing of this great ſtumbling block, conſider that thy ſinnes are but finite at theAnſw. I muſt confeſſe, if a man ſhould goe about to know what God is by thoſe definitions, and deſcrAnſw. The Scribes and Phariſees, ſought righteouſneſſe only by the works of the Law, which made noneAnſw. The Devill hath many wayes to keep poor ſoules in a ſad doubting and queſtioning condition, ſoAnſ. Shall we make account that God is like unto Pharaoh, to command the full tale of brick, and givAnſ. My adviſe is, That thou wouldſt own all men and women, let them go under what name ſoever, if tObj. But I cannot ſee nor heare of any ſuch pure Church upon earth as you have hinted at,and with whAnſw. The Church of God in Scripture is reſembled to a naturall body, wherein are many Members uniteObj. But I am a little unſatisfied in this, ſaith ſome ſoule, I heare that thoſe Churches that walk Anſw. Their exerciſing their gifts may be proved by theſe four demonſtrations:1. By examples in the Obj.

But I am an old Sinner, and have one foot already in the grave, ſaith another trembling Soule.Anſw. Chriſt doth call ſome at the ninth houre, yea ſome at the eleventh houre, and ſaith, Jer. 3. 5Obj. But is there nothing in the way that hindersmen and women that are willing to come to Chriſt? aAnſw. There is nothing on Gods part, for he hath taken all things out of the way, that hindred thee Obj. But, ſaith another timerous weak ſoule, I am a lyar, and the Lord ſaith in the Revelation, thatAnſw. The houſe of Iſrael and the houſe of Judah dealt treacherouſly againſt the Lord, and belyed hiObj.
